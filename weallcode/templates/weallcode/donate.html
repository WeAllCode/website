          <h2>Are there other ways to give?</h2>

          <p>Yes, here are a couple:</p>

          <h3 id="benevity-giving">Benevity Workplace Giving Program</h3>

          <p>We All Code is pleased to be a participant in the <strong><a href="http://www.benevity.com" target="_blank" >Benevity Workplace Giving Program</a></strong>. When your employer becomes a member of the Benevity community, you are able to make donations to We All Code via payroll deduction. Many employers offer a matching contribution as well, increasing the amount that We All Code receives from your donation.</p>

          <p>Benevity is available to employers in any country, and works with your company’s payroll department for ease of use from set up to payments.</p>

          <p>Check with your employer to see if they participate in Benevity, or visit the <a href="http://www.benevity.com" target="_blank" >Benevity</a> site to find out more if your employer is not yet part of the Benevity program.</p>

          <h3 id="amazon-smile">Amazon Smile</h3>

          <p>We All Code is a recipient for <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/ch/46-4988098" target="_blank" >Amazon Smile</a>. When you shop at Amazon, you can nominate for 0.5% of the purchase price of your eligible AmazonSmile purchases to be donated to We All Code.</p>

          <h2 id="donation-usage">How will my donation be used?</h2>

          <!-- TODO: Fill this out -->
          <p>Fill this out</p>

          <h2 id="corporate-donations">Do you accept donations from companies/corporations?</h2>

          <p>Yes. We also have a corporate sponsorship program. <a href="/contact/foundation/">Get in touch</a> if you'd like to know more.</p>

          <h2 id="specific-feature">Can I choose a specific feature or project to support?</h2>

          <p>No: we don't allow donors to directly sponsor specific features.</p>

          <p>However, we may be able to connect you to a Django developer who you can hire to work on a specific feature. Please <a href="/contact/foundation/">get in touch</a> if this sounds like something you'd like to pursue.</p>

          <h2 id="tax-deductible">Is my donation tax deductible?</h2>

          <p>We All Code is a non-profit corporation; we have tax-exempt status under IRC 501(c)(3). This means that donations are tax-deductible for US citizens; donors outside of the United States should consult a tax advisor.</p>

          <h2 id="donation-alternatives">How can I donate if Stripe won't process my payment?</h2>

          <p>Please <a href="mailto:fundraising@djangoproject.com">get in touch</a> with us, and we'll figure something out that works for you.</p>
