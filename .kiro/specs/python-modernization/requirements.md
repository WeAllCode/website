# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves updating the We All Code Django application to use the latest version of Python (3.13) and modernizing the codebase to leverage native Python functions and modern language features. The goal is to improve performance, maintainability, and take advantage of the latest Python capabilities while maintaining full compatibility with the existing Django application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the latest Python version (3.13) so that I can benefit from performance improvements, security updates, and new language features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL use Python 3.13.x as the runtime
2. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN they SHALL be compatible with Python 3.13
3. WHEN the Docker container is built THEN it SHALL use Python 3.13 base image
4. WHEN the development environment is set up THEN it SHALL use Python 3.13 with uv package manager

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use modern Python type annotations so that I can improve code clarity and catch type-related errors early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN utility functions are defined THEN they SHALL include proper type annotations using modern Python syntax
2. WHEN function parameters are defined THEN they SHALL use built-in generic types (list, dict, tuple) instead of typing module equivalents where possible
3. WHEN return types are specified THEN they SHALL use the most appropriate modern type annotation syntax
4. WHEN optional parameters are used THEN they SHALL use the modern union syntax (X | None) instead of Optional[X]

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace custom utility functions with native Python equivalents so that the code is more maintainable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN batching operations are needed THEN the system SHALL use modern Python itertools or built-in functions instead of custom implementations
2. WHEN string operations are performed THEN they SHALL use f-strings and modern string methods
3. WHEN collection operations are needed THEN they SHALL use built-in functions like enumerate, zip, and comprehensions appropriately
4. WHEN file operations are performed THEN they SHALL use pathlib instead of os.path where appropriate

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Docker configuration updated to use Python 3.13 so that the containerized environment matches the latest Python version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Dockerfile is built THEN it SHALL use python:3.13 as the base image
2. WHEN the .python-version file is read THEN it SHALL specify 3.13
3. WHEN pyproject.toml is parsed THEN it SHALL require Python >=3.13,<3.14
4. WHEN uv is used THEN it SHALL properly resolve dependencies for Python 3.13

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all dependencies to be compatible with Python 3.13 so that the application runs without compatibility issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are resolved THEN they SHALL all support Python 3.13
2. WHEN the application starts THEN there SHALL be no deprecation warnings related to Python version compatibility
3. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL pass on Python 3.13
4. WHEN production deployment occurs THEN it SHALL use Python 3.13 without issues

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to modernize code patterns to use current Python best practices so that the codebase is more readable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exception handling is implemented THEN it SHALL use modern exception chaining and context managers where appropriate
2. WHEN data structures are manipulated THEN they SHALL use modern Python idioms like walrus operator where beneficial
3. WHEN async operations are needed THEN they SHALL use modern async/await patterns
4. WHEN configuration is handled THEN it SHALL use modern approaches like dataclasses or Pydantic where appropriate
