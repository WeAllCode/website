# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze current configuration and establish baseline

  - Analyze current Poetry configuration in pyproject.toml
  - Test current application functionality as baseline using Docker
  - Document current build times and performance metrics
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 4.4_

- [x] 2. Update Docker configuration for uv

  - Modify Dockerfile to install uv instead of Poetry
  - Update Dockerfile to use `uv sync` for dependency installation
  - Remove Poetry-specific environment variables from Dockerfile
  - Test Docker build process with new uv configuration
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1_

- [x] 3. Create uv project structure and migrate dependencies using Docker

  - Use Docker container with uv to run `uv init` and create proper uv project files (.python-version, uv.lock)
  - Migrate dependency specifications from Poetry format to uv-compatible format in pyproject.toml
  - Generate uv.lock file from migrated dependencies using Docker environment
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 4. Remove conflicting package manager files

  - Remove poetry.lock file to prevent Poetry from taking precedence
  - Search for and remove any requirements.txt files in the project
  - Search for and remove any Pipfile or Pipfile.lock files
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 5. Test application with uv dependencies in Docker

  - Install dependencies using `uv sync` in Docker container
  - Run Django application in Docker with uv-managed environment
  - Execute full test suite to verify functionality
  - Compare dependency versions between old poetry.lock and new uv.lock
  - Test Docker container functionality with complete uv setup
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 6. Remove deprecated Poetry buildpack from Heroku

  - Check current Heroku buildpack configuration with `heroku buildpacks`
  - Remove the deprecated Poetry buildpack using exact URL/name
  - Verify buildpack removal with subsequent `heroku buildpacks` command
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 7. Deploy to staging environment and validate

  - Deploy application to Heroku staging environment
  - Monitor deployment logs to confirm uv is being used
  - Verify Python 3.11.9 is being used as specified in .python-version
  - Test all critical application functionality in staging
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 8. Performance testing and monitoring setup

  - Measure and document build times compared to Poetry baseline
  - Verify dependency installation performance improvements
  - Test subsequent deployments to confirm caching benefits
  - Monitor application startup times and error rates
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 9. Production deployment and final validation

  - Deploy to production environment using new uv configuration
  - Monitor deployment logs for successful uv usage
  - Verify all application functionality works in production
  - Document performance improvements and any issues encountered
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_
